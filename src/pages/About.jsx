      <h1>ABOUT</h1>
      <p>Hi There! I am Megumi Kawagoe based in Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p>
      <p>I'm a passionate Frontend developer, born and brought up in Japan.</p>
      <p>I started coding from HTML, CSS,  jQuery and WordPress at Manabito.co in 2020.
        Through learning jQuery, I was eager to learn from fundamental to a wide range of JavaScript. 
        Then I decided to move into Europe and joined Ironhack Fullstack Web Development Bootcamp in 2021.</p>
      <p>I like working with a team, especially those who have different backgrounds. 
        So every moment of experiences at Bootcamp was fun, intense and very stimulating.</p>
      {/* <p>Because I always put myself to step out of my comfort zone, being passionate about web design and JavaScript and my diligence of learning new skills are never ending.</p> */}
